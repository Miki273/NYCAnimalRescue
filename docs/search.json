    "text": "1.1 Context for Readers\nIn urban environments, where human activities dominate the landscape, animals often face unique challenges that require intervention. Habitat loss, vehicle collisions, and exposure to pollutants or human structures can leave animals injured, displaced, or in distress. Thus, urban wildlife rescue and relocation have become essential in ensuring the welfare of animals while maintaining public safety. In particular, NYC Urban park ranger program plays a major role in helping us coexist with our wild neighbors. Rangers are on call to attend to injured wildlife and are there to help people learn more about how to keep them wild and how to safely view the wildest residents.",

    "text": "1.2 Motivation\nWe choose this topic because analyzing and visualizing patterns in urban wildlife incidents allows us to uncover valuable insights into how animals interact with urban environments. Understanding these patterns—such as the most common species involved, seasonal trends, or the distribution of incidents across different areas—can reveal the underlying dynamics of urban ecosystems. This topic is important because it highlights the challenges and opportunities in managing human-wildlife interactions, providing a clearer picture of how urbanization impacts biodiversity. By analyzing these patterns, we can better understand the needs of urban wildlife and how cities like New York can adapt to foster sustainable coexistence with their wild neighbors. This can further help improve urban planning, public awareness, and conservation strategies, ensuring cities remain livable for both humans and wildlife.",

    "text": "1.3 Research Questions\nIn this study, we aim to analyze the dataset containing wildlife incidents and ranger responses to understand how various factors influence patterns of animal rescue and assistance. The questions we aim to investigate are as follow:\n\nTrends in Animal Assistance Requests: Are there any seasonal or monthly patterns in the data?\nGeographic Distribution: Which areas report the most incidents?\nTypes of Incidents and Animals Involved: What are the most common types of assistance or rescues requested? Which animals are most frequently involved?\nResponse Times and Efficiency: Does response time vary by type of incident or location?\nImpact of External Factor: How do urban development correlate with incident patterns?",
