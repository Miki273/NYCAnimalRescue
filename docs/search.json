    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn urban environments, where human activities dominate the landscape, animals often face unique challenges that require intervention. Habitat loss, vehicle collisions, and exposure to pollutants or human structures can leave animals injured, displaced, or in distress. Thus, urban wildlife rescue and relocation have become essential for ensuring the welfare of animals while maintaining public safety, especially in big cities. Therefore, we decided to use exploratory data analysis to study patterns in urban wildlife incidents from the NYC Urban Park Ranger Program. Questions we are interested in include the most common species involved, seasonal trends, the spatial distribution of incidents, as well as the connection between these factors and animal assistance requests and responses. This can help us gain crucial insights about optimizing resource allocation, improving response time, and better anticipating areas or situations that require focused attention. With this information, cities like New York can adapt to promote sustainable coexistence with wildlife, improve urban planning, enhance public awareness, and develop effective conservation strategies.",

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nFor the proposed project, we plan to utilize a dataset called Urban Park Ranger Animal Condition Response available at NYC OpenData. This dataset is recorded during animal condition response incidents handled by park rangers and collected by Urban Park Rangers of the New York City Parks Department. It is published and maintained by NYC OpenData and is updated every 6 months for analysis.\nThe dataset comprises 6,385 rows and 22 columns. For our project, we have chosen the CSV format of the dataset. Other formats of the data, such as RDF, XML, and RSS, are also available on the source website. Notably, the data includes requests for animal assistance, relocation, and rescue completed by the Urban Park Rangers. Requests are typically made by other Parks staff, park visitors making requests in person, and by calls to 311. Each record represents a single request.\nHowever, a potential issue regarding the dataset is the presence of numerous “unfounded” final responses, meaning that the incident reported could not be verified upon the ranger’s arrival. This can introduce problems when analyzing related variables, such as animal condition and number of animals involved.",
