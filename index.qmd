# Introduction

In urban environments, where human activities dominate the landscape, animals often face unique challenges that require intervention. Habitat loss, vehicle collisions, and exposure to pollutants or human structures can leave animals injured, displaced, or in distress. Thus, urban wildlife rescue and relocation have become essential for ensuring the welfare of animals while maintaining public safety, especially in big cities. Therefore, we decided to use exploratory data analysis to study patterns in urban wildlife incidents from the NYC Urban Park Ranger Program. Questions we are interested in include the most common species involved, seasonal trends, the spatial distribution of incidents, as well as the connection between these factors and animal assistance requests and responses. This can help us gain crucial insights about optimizing resource allocation, improving response time, and better anticipating areas or situations that require focused attention. With this information, cities like New York can adapt to promote sustainable coexistence with wildlife, improve urban planning, enhance public awareness, and develop effective conservation strategies.
